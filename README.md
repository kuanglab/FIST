# FIST: Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion
## Summary of the package
In this repo, we provide the MATLAB implementation of FIST algorithm:
- **data:** we provide two sample sptRNA-seq datasets: 1) mouse kidney section data from 10x Genomics (https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/datasets/) for cross-validation evaluation, and 2) the hdst mouse olfactory bulb data CN24_E1 generated by Vickovic, et al 2019
- **cross_validation.m**: script for comparing FIST and spatialNN by doing cross-validation on the mouse kidney section dataset
- **HDST_main.m**: measure the time of running FIST on the hdst CN24_E1 dataset
- **FIST.m:** function of the FIST algorithm
- **spatialNN.m**: an imputation approach based on searching the spatially nearest spots
- **get_rank.m:** determine the tensor CPD-rank by PCA
- **scatter_plot.m**: generate the scatter plot of the cross-validation results


Note: the tensor framework of our FIST implementation is based on [MATLAB Tensor Toolbox](http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/), please install it first. 
Alternatively, you can download the tensor_toolbox package from https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox as change your work directory to tensor_toolbox.
